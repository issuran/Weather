# Weather

## Setup :hammer:
- First of all, you need to have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), enter the command inside the project to install its dependencies:
`pod install`

- You may have an account at [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org) to use their API, when you use pod install, you have to give your api key to it.

- And you should be ready to go!
